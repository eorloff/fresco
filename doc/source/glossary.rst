   protocol

      A specification of how a number of parties perform a given task
      by doing computation and interacting.

   protocol suite

      A collection of protocols that is designed to be used together
      in order to do secure computation. An example is the :ref:`BGW
      <BGW>` protocol suite.

   native protocol
   composite protocol

      A *native* protocol is a protocol that is supported directly by
      a given protocol suite. The BGW suite contains native protocols
      for addition and multiplication, for example. A *composite*
      protocol is a protocol that is built from simpler protocols. For
      example, in the BGW suite you can easily obtain a composite
      protocol for subtraction, comparison, or sorting.

   application

      An application is just a protocol that performs some task. In
      that sense any protocol in FRESCO is an application. But there
      are many protocols and not all will make sense to those that
      want to use FRESCO for secure computation. we have included the
      ``Application`` interface that can be used to mark certain
      protocols as suitable for end users. An example of an
      application is the ``AESDemo`` from the
      ``dk.alexandra.fresco.demo`` package.

   computation parties

      This is the parties needed to carry out a protocol suite. For
      example, three or more computation parties are required to run
      the :ref:`BGW <BGW>` protocol suite.

   input/output parties

      This is parties that give input to and/or receive output from a
      secure computation.

   preprocessing model

      Some protocol suites such as :ref:`SPDZ <SPDZ>` are divided in
      two phases. In the *offline* phase the computation parties carry
      out computation that is *independent* of the input from the
      input parties. Later, in the *online* phase, the computation
      parties can then use the offline material to do a more efficient
      computation.

   reactive protocol suite
   reactive application

      A reactive computation is a computation where intermediate
      values are opened up and further computation may depend on the
      opened values. Some protocol suites such as :ref:`BGW <BGW>` and
      :ref:`SPDZ <SPDZ>` support reactive computation while others do
      not.

   secure computation engine

      The core of FRESCO. It is the coordinating mind which ensures that all is
      setup correctly given the configurations of the user. It is also the
      entry point for developers where applications are run from. 

   security parameter
   statistical security parameter
   computational security parameter

      Protocol suites are essentially cryptographic protocols. Such
      protocols are usually parameterized by a *security
      parameter*. This is a positive integer that can vary. The
      intuition is that the protocol gets *exponentially* harder to
      break when the security parameter grows. Without going in too
      much detail, the *computational* security parameter, usually
      denoted by :math:`k`, roughly states that the protocol is
      designed such that an adversary must use at least :math:`2^k`
      operations to break it. Typical values for a practical, secure
      setup are :math:`k \in \{128, \dots, 256\}`. The *statistical*
      security parameter, denoted by :math:`s`, is not concerned with
      the computational power of the adversary, but roughly states
      that the probability that the protocol breaks is bounded by
      :math:`2^{-s}`. Typical values of :math:`s` are 40 or 80. For
      more on this, consult cryptography text books such as [KL14]_ or
      [CDN15]_.

   information theoretic security
   computational security
   perfect security

      Information theoretic security refers to a kind of security that
      is not dependent on the computational power of the
      adversary. There may be some risk of breaking the protocol, but
      this risk do not grow if the adversary achieves more processing
      power. *Perfect* security is information theoretic security
      where the probability of breaking the protocol is zero.

   honest majority

      Denotes that the majority of parties in a multiparty computation are
      honest - i.e. they behave as they should according to the protocol.
